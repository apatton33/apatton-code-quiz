## Description
    I was tasked through the acceptance criteria to build a JavaScript Quiz.
    It needed a start button and when clicked would start a timer and present the 
    first question of the quiz. After you click your answer it move onto the next 
    question and deduct time if it is wrong. Once done with the quiz it will take 
    you to the end page signifying the end of the quiz.



    ## Usage
    It is a JavaScript quiz implementing what we learned in class into a
    deployed site. You can answer a few questions through a timed structure.
    If you get the question wrong the time will lower.
